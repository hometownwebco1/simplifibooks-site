      <p className="text-sm text-gray-500">Written for DIY bookkeepers. This article is educational and does not constitute accounting advice.</p>
      <div className="mt-6">
        <p className='mb-4 text-gray-800'>The line between an owner draw and a business expense is sharper than many DIY bookkeepers realize. Misclassifying owner transactions inflates expenses, distorts profits, and can invite scrutiny at tax time. This guide clarifies what belongs where and gives you a simple process to code owner activity accurately every month.</p>

<p className='mb-4 text-gray-800'>Owner draws are non‑deductible distributions of profit to the owner. They reduce equity, not expense. If you pay a personal credit card or withdraw cash for non‑business use, those transactions should hit an equity account such as Owner’s Draw/Distribution. Recording them as meals, travel, or office supplies artificially lowers profit and misleads anyone reading the P&L.</p>

<p className='mb-4 text-gray-800'>Owner contributions are the flip side: money you put into the business. These should be coded to an equity account such as Owner’s Contribution/Capital. Don’t book them as income; doing so overstates revenue and can cause sales tax or other compliance issues.</p>

<p className='mb-4 text-gray-800'>Create a dedicated bank rule set for owner activity. For example, transfers from your personal account to the business checking with the memo “Owner” should post to contributions. ATM cash withdrawals should default to Owner’s Draw unless you attach a receipt proving a business purpose. Rules don’t remove judgment, but they dramatically reduce miscoding.</p>

<p className='mb-4 text-gray-800'>If you use a business credit card for both business and personal, reconcile every month and split mixed transactions immediately. The longer you wait, the harder it is to remember what was what. Develop a discipline that anything without a receipt or clear business purpose is treated as personal and coded to equity.</p>

<p className='mb-4 text-gray-800'>Finally, review your Balance Sheet equity section quarterly. Large, unexplained swings mean owner activity is likely being posted inconsistently. Document a short policy — one page is enough — that defines how you treat common edge cases so the rules survive even if someone else helps with the books.</p>

<p className='mb-4 text-gray-800'>Clean separation between owner and business isn’t just an accounting nicety; it drives better decisions and protects you at tax time. If you want a second set of eyes to confirm owner entries are being handled correctly, SimplifiBooks can review them every month and flag anything that needs reclassification.</p>
