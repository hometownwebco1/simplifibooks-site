# SimplifiBooks Site

Next.js (App Router) + Tailwind site for SimplifiBooks.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Lead capture → GHL

Set `GHL_WEBHOOK_URL` in your Vercel project env vars to forward form submissions to your GoHighLevel webhook/form. The built‑in form will still function and redirect to `/thank-you` even if the env var is not set, so you can ship now and wire GHL later.

## Deploy

Push to GitHub and import in Vercel. No other setup required.
